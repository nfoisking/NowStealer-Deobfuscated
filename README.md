# NowStealer-Deobfuscated
This is reverse engineering a shitty Brazilian stealer.

# Why?
I deobfuscated this entire stealer in order to prove that it has dualhook and that it is the worst stealer of all. This Brazilian stealer is famous for being the former owner of Iluria Stealer, but it's as shit as the iluria itself.

# Credits
- Thanks to Hypexx for the executable. Without the Exe it would not be possible to reverse engineer.

# How does this stealer work in practice?
- It works like this: when you run it, it opens a fake NSIS executor and injects it into your Discord. After that, it restarts and closes all your browsers/Discord, then steals all your passwords and cookies completely silently. Then, all the victim's information is sent to the hacker.
Warning: This stealer uses my stealer's base! (Lxnny)
